	\section*{Hall's Theorem}
	\myt{Hall's Theorem}: G bipartite (A,B). There is a matching that saturates A if and only if $\forall x \subseteq A$, $\underset{Hall's Condition}{|N(x)| \geq|x|}$\\
	
	\myt{Proof:}\\
	$\implies$ (Done last class, whoops!)\\
	$\impliedby$ (contrapositive if no matchign saturates A, then $\exists x \subseteq A$ where $|N(X) < |X|$)\\
	
	Let M be a maximum matching. By assumption, $|M| < |A|$\\
	Let C be a minumum cover. By Konig's theorem $|C|=|M|<|A|$\\
	
	Note that no edge joins A/C to B/C since none of these vertices are in the cover. So M(A/C) $\subseteq B \cap C$\\
	So $$|N(A/C)| \leq |B\cap C|$$
	$$= |C| - |A \cap C|$$
	$$ < |A| - |A \cap C|$$
	(since $|C| < |A|$)\\
	$$= |A/C|$$
	
	So $|N(A/C)| < |A/C|$ meaning A/C violates Hall's Condition\\
	
	\myt{Corollary:} If G is a k-regular bipartite graph with k $\geq 1$ then G has a perfect matching\\
	
	\myt{Proof:} Suppose G has bipartition (A,B). We claim that $|A| = |B|$ : from assignment,\\
	$$\sum_{v \in A}deg(v) = \sum_{v\in B}deg(v)$$
	$$\sum_{v \in A}k \in \sum_{v \in B}k$$
	So k$|A| = k|B|$ since $k \neq 0$, $|A| = |B|$\\
	
	Let $x \subseteq A$. Any edge with one end in X must have the other end in N(x). So $\sum_{v \in N(x)}deg(v) \geq\sum_{v \in X}deg(v)$\\
	Since G is k-regular, $k|N(x)| \geq k|x|$\\
	
	Since $k >= 1$, $|N(x)| \geq|X|$ so Hall's condition holds for all $X \leq A$ by Hall's Theorem, there is a matching. Since $|A| = |B|$, this matching is a perfect matching.\\
