Major Topics to Study for 241 Midterm:

1. binary + hex
	- sign magnitude
	- ones complement
	- twos complement
2. the machine
	- cpu, alu, ram, registers, bus, etc.
	- how does the cpu work
	- loading instructions, PC etc.
	- storing with RAM
3. ASM Language
	- instructions, labels
	- using stack pointers properly
	- jumping and linking registers
	- function and procedure templates
	- I/O
4. Assembler
	- tokenizing
	- lexer
	- symbol tables
	- opcode
	- how does an OS work
	- machine code vs object code
5. MERL
	- relocation + relocation tables
	- format of a MERL file
	- loading a MERL file
	- linking multiple MERL files together
	- imports, exports, ESD's and ESR's
6. High Level Languages
 	- definitions + types
 	- finite languages
 	- state machines
7. DFA's, NFA's
	- how they both work
	- regexes
	- regular languages
	- 5-tuples
	- Kleene's Theorem
	- each nfa must have a corresponding dfa and each dfa is an nfa
	- epsilon-NFA's
	- maximal munch algorithm
8. Parsing
	- context-free grammars
	- definitions
	- derivations
	- parse trees
	- inherently ambiguous grammars
